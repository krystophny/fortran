# *Lazy Fortran* Compiler Frontend TODO

This document tracks concrete implementation tasks for the *lazy fortran* compiler frontend.
Our architectural plans and designs live in `doc/plan/` directory, while this TODO.md is for specific actionable tasks.

## Vision
We are building a complete compiler frontend with a 4-phase architecture (Lexer → Parser → Semantic Analysis → Code Generation) that can target multiple backends. Our *lazy fortran* dialect pushes beyond all alternative scientific computing languages, exploring how far we can evolve Fortran to surpass Python, Julia, MATLAB, and others in both performance and expressiveness. Currently, we use standard Fortran as our intermediate representation, which allows immediate use with existing Fortran compilers.

## IMMEDIATE TASKS ⚡

### Standard Fortran Compatibility Tests 🔄
Since *lazy fortran* is a superset of standard Fortran, we need comprehensive tests to ensure any valid Fortran 95/2003/2008/2018 program passes through unchanged:

- [ ] **Create test/standard_fortran/** directory for compatibility tests
- [ ] **Fortran 95 Core Features**:
  - [ ] Program/module/subroutine/function structures
  - [ ] All intrinsic types and declarations
  - [ ] Arrays (static, dynamic, assumed-shape)
  - [ ] Control structures (if/then/else, do loops, select case)
  - [ ] Operators and expressions
  - [ ] Intrinsic functions
  - [ ] Format statements and I/O
  - [ ] Common blocks (legacy but required)
  - [ ] Data statements
  - [ ] Equivalence statements
  - [ ] Parameter statements
- [ ] **Fortran 2003 Features**:
  - [ ] Object-oriented programming constructs
  - [ ] Type-bound procedures
  - [ ] Abstract interfaces
  - [ ] Parameterized derived types
  - [ ] Allocatable components
- [ ] **Fortran 2008/2018 Features**:
  - [ ] Coarrays
  - [ ] Submodules
  - [ ] DO CONCURRENT
  - [ ] ERROR STOP
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**:
  - [ ] Compare frontend output byte-for-byte with input for standard files
  - [ ] Test suite from Fortran standards committee examples
  - [ ] Real-world Fortran libraries (BLAS, LAPACK snippets)
  - [ ] Ensure no modifications to standard constructs

### ✅ COMPLETED: Test Cleanup and Deduplication
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Read through ALL test files in each category before deciding to delete
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Understand what each test does and why it exists
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Only delete tests that are genuinely flakey, shallow, or nonsensical after proper analysis
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Remove duplication in tests - keep only the deepest test that covers a specific portion of code
- [x] **COMPLETED**: For each code area, identify the most comprehensive test and remove redundant ones
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Go through each test category systematically: cache/, config/, cli/, preprocessor/, lexer/, type/
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Removed 19 redundant test files (94 → 75 files) while maintaining complete coverage

#### Test Hierarchy Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/modules in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interaction between components
- **System tests**: Test full end-to-end functionality
- **Keep only ONE comprehensive test per category that covers the deepest level needed**
- **Remove shallow "smoke tests" that just print PASS without real verification**
