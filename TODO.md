# Full Type Inference Implementation

## Goal
Complete the lexer → parser → semantic analyzer → codegen pipeline for standardizing lazy fortran to Fortran 95, with full Hindley-Milner type inference using Algorithm W.

## Pipeline Architecture

The 4-phase compiler pipeline with JSON intermediate representations:

1. **Lexer**: Source Code → Tokens (outputs tokens.json with --debug-tokens)
2. **Parser**: Tokens → AST (inputs tokens via --from-tokens, outputs ast.json with --debug-ast)
3. **Semantic Analyzer**: AST → Annotated AST (inputs/outputs AST via --from-ast, adds type info with --debug-semantic)
4. **Code Generator**: AST → Fortran 95 code (inputs any AST via --from-ast)

Key insights:
1. The semantic analyzer augments the AST with type information but maintains the same structure
2. Both parser and semantic analyzer use the same JSON serialization (json_writer/json_reader modules)
3. The code generator accepts any AST via --from-ast, whether typed or untyped:
   - **Standard Fortran**: Parser → AST → Codegen (types already explicit)
   - **Lazy Fortran**: Parser → AST → Semantic Analysis → Annotated AST → Codegen (types inferred)
