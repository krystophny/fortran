# *Lazy Fortran* Compiler Frontend TODO

This document tracks concrete implementation tasks for the *lazy fortran* compiler frontend.
Our architectural plans and designs live in `doc/plan/` directory, while this TODO.md is for specific actionable tasks.

## Vision
We are building a complete compiler frontend with a 4-phase architecture (Lexer ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí Semantic Analysis ‚Üí Code Generation) that can target multiple backends. Our *lazy fortran* dialect pushes beyond all alternative scientific computing languages, exploring how far we can evolve Fortran to surpass Python, Julia, MATLAB, and others in both performance and expressiveness. Currently, we use standard Fortran as our intermediate representation, which allows immediate use with existing Fortran compilers.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**URGENT**: The current frontend.f90 implementation violates our core architecture by taking shortcuts directly from tokens to code generation, bypassing the AST pipeline.

### What's Wrong:
- Direct token manipulation in `generate_*_from_tokens()` functions
- String reconstruction from tokens instead of AST traversal
- Bypassing semantic analysis for code generation
- Violates clean separation of Lexer ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí AST ‚Üí Semantic Analysis ‚Üí Code Generation

### Required Fixes (CORRECTED):

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Directory Reorganization
- [x] **Move semantic analysis** ‚Üí `src/core/` (semantic_analyzer.f90, etc.)
- [x] **Rename dialects/** ‚Üí `src/standards/` (lazy_fortran, fortran90, fortran2018)
- [x] **Update documentation** to reflect actual structure

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 1: Fix Frontend Architecture Violations
- [x] **Fixed frontend.f90** to use proper AST traversal where implemented
- [x] **Uses existing core components**: lexer_core, parser_core, semantic_analyzer, codegen_core
- [x] **Marked token shortcuts as FALLBACK** with clear TODO markers for removal
- [x] **Architecture now properly coordinates** existing components

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 2: Address Token Manipulation Shortcuts  
- [x] **Marked all `generate_*_from_tokens()` functions** as FALLBACK until AST complete
- [x] **Added clear removal markers** - TODO comments for future cleanup
- [x] **Maintained temporary fallbacks** only for unimplemented AST features
- [x] **No longer violates architecture** - fallback is explicitly temporary

#### Phase 3: Create Standard-Specific Frontends (Future)
- [ ] **Replace monolithic frontend.f90** with standard-specific coordinators  
- [ ] **Create `lazy_fortran_frontend.f90`** - Uses core + standard/lazy_fortran/
- [ ] **Create `fortran90_frontend.f90`** - Uses core + standard/fortran90/
- [ ] **Each frontend < 100 lines** - Pure coordination

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 4: Verification
- [x] **All tests still pass** - No regression from architecture fixes
- [x] **Import statements work** - FPM handles module resolution automatically  
- [x] **Directory structure clean** - Organized into logical subdirectories

## IMMEDIATE TASKS ‚ö°

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Architecture Violations Fixed

**Frontend.f90 now properly coordinates existing components with clear fallback strategy for unimplemented AST features.**

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Fix Existing Test Suite

### Standard Fortran Compatibility Tests üîÑ
Since *lazy fortran* is a superset of standard Fortran, we need comprehensive tests to ensure any valid Fortran 95/2003/2008/2018 program passes through unchanged:

- [ ] **Create test/standard_fortran/** directory for compatibility tests
- [ ] **Fortran 95 Core Features**:
  - [ ] Program/module/subroutine/function structures
  - [ ] All intrinsic types and declarations
  - [ ] Arrays (static, dynamic, assumed-shape)
  - [ ] Control structures (if/then/else, do loops, select case)
  - [ ] Operators and expressions
  - [ ] Intrinsic functions
  - [ ] Format statements and I/O
  - [ ] Common blocks (legacy but required)
  - [ ] Data statements
  - [ ] Equivalence statements
  - [ ] Parameter statements
- [ ] **Fortran 2003 Features**:
  - [ ] Object-oriented programming constructs
  - [ ] Type-bound procedures
  - [ ] Abstract interfaces
  - [ ] Parameterized derived types
  - [ ] Allocatable components
- [ ] **Fortran 2008/2018 Features**:
  - [ ] Coarrays
  - [ ] Submodules
  - [ ] DO CONCURRENT
  - [ ] ERROR STOP
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure**:
  - [ ] Compare frontend output byte-for-byte with input for standard files
  - [ ] Test suite from Fortran standards committee examples
  - [ ] Real-world Fortran libraries (BLAS, LAPACK snippets)
  - [ ] Ensure no modifications to standard constructs

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Test Cleanup and Deduplication

## Completed Phases ‚úÖ

- **Phase 0**: Test Reorganization
