# Full Type Inference Implementation

## Goal
Complete the lexer → parser → semantic analyzer → codegen pipeline for standardizing lazy fortran to Fortran 95, with full Hindley-Milner type inference using Algorithm W.

## Pipeline Architecture

The 4-phase compiler pipeline with JSON intermediate representations:

1. **Lexer**: Source Code → Tokens (outputs tokens.json with --debug-tokens)
2. **Parser**: Tokens → AST (inputs tokens via --from-tokens, outputs ast.json with --debug-ast)
3. **Semantic Analyzer**: AST → Annotated AST (inputs/outputs AST via --from-ast, adds type info with --debug-semantic)
4. **Code Generator**: AST → Fortran 95 code (inputs any AST via --from-ast)

Key insights:
1. The semantic analyzer augments the AST with type information but maintains the same structure
2. Both parser and semantic analyzer use the same JSON serialization (json_writer/json_reader modules)
3. The code generator accepts any AST via --from-ast, whether typed or untyped:
   - **Standard Fortran**: Parser → AST → Codegen (types already explicit)
   - **Lazy Fortran**: Parser → AST → Semantic Analysis → Annotated AST → Codegen (types inferred)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All lazy fortran features compile to valid Fortran 95
- [ ] Double standardization test: Running standardizer on its own output produces identical results
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all Fortran 95 features via frontend_test_cases
- [ ] JSON intermediate representations work correctly at all stages
- [ ] No shortcuts - everything goes through the real AST pipeline

## Parser Refactoring Project ✅ MAJOR SUCCESS

### Summary of Achievements
The parser refactoring project has been successfully completed through 4 phases:
- **Phase 1**: Extracted state, expressions, and declarations modules
- **Phase 2**: Extracted statement parsing functions  
- **Phase 3**: Extracted control flow parsing functions
- **Phase 4**: Implemented clean dispatcher pattern

**Final Result**: parser_core.f90 reduced from 2635 → 866 lines (67% reduction!)

### Goal ✅ ACHIEVED
Extract smaller, focused modules from large pipeline modules to improve maintainability and follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

### Modules to Refactor
- [ ] **lexer_core.f90** (548 lines) - Extract token type definitions, keyword management, operator handling
- [x] **parser_core.f90** (2635 → 866 lines) ✅ MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETE:
  - [x] Phase 1: Created `parser_state.f90` - Parser state management (84 lines)
  - [x] Phase 1: Created `parser_expressions.f90` - Expression parsing hierarchy (385 lines)
  - [x] Phase 1: Created `parser_declarations.f90` - Declaration and type parsing (448 lines)
  - [x] Phase 2: Created `parser_statements.f90` - Statement parsing functions (moved from parser_core)
  - [x] Phase 3: Enhanced `parser_control_flow.f90` - All control flow parsing (if/do/while/select)
  - [x] Phase 4: Implemented `parser_dispatcher.f90` - Clean dispatcher pattern (189 lines)
  - [x] Total reduction: ~1769 lines extracted from parser_core (67% reduction!)
  - [x] All tests pass after refactoring
  - [x] Clean separation of concerns achieved
  - [x] Project builds successfully and all parser functionality verified
- [x] **ast_core.f90** (1425 → 307 lines) ✅ MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETE:
  - [x] Phase 1: Created `ast_types.f90` - All AST node type definitions (550 lines)
  - [x] Phase 2: Created `ast_factory.f90` - All factory functions (428 lines)
  - [x] Phase 3: Created `ast_visitor.f90` - Visitor pattern implementations (140 lines)
  - [x] Phase 4: Created `ast_json.f90` - JSON serialization methods (420 lines)

- [x] **json_writer.f90** (137 lines) - Already small, no refactoring needed
- [ ] **frontend.f90** (723 lines) - Within target size, lower priority for refactoring

### Refactoring Strategy
1. Identify logical boundaries within each module
2. Extract cohesive functionality into dedicated modules
3. Update use statements and maintain clean interfaces
4. Ensure all tests pass after each extraction
5. Follow naming convention: `<module>_<component>.f90`
6. Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) throughout

### Target Module Sizes
- Core modules: < 1000 lines
- Component modules: < 500 lines
- Utility modules: < 300 lines

### Additional Refactoring Opportunities
**Parser Statement Dispatcher Pattern** - Created example modules showing how to further refactor the large `parse_statement` function:
- `parser_dispatcher.f90` - Clean switch logic that delegates to specialized modules
- `parser_control_flow.f90` - Handles if/do/select constructs  
- `parser_statements.f90` - Handles use/include/print/function/subroutine/module statements

This approach would eliminate the massive switch statement and improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility. Implementation would further reduce parser_core.f90 size and improve code organization.

### Current Phase: Testing & Validation (Phase 5)

**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and validation of the refactored parser modules to ensure all functionality is preserved and coverage is maintained.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run full test suite with coverage: `fpm test --flag '-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'`

**Issue**: Code coverage may only be working on main branch despite CI workflow running on all branches.

- [x] **Add codecov.yml configuration** if missing: ✅
  ```yaml
  # .codecov.yml
  coverage:
    status:
      project:
        default:
          target: 85%
          threshold: 2%
      patch:
        default:
          target: 90%
  ignore:
    - "build/**/*"
    - "example/**/*"
    - "draft/**/*"
  ```
- [ ] **Verify CI workflow branch triggers**:
  - Current: `on: [push, pull_request]` ✅ (should work for all branches)
  - Test coverage upload with `CODECOV_TOKEN` ✅ (configured)
- [ ] **Test coverage on feature branch**:
  - Create test branch with dummy change
  - Verify coverage report generates and uploads
  - Check codecov.io shows coverage for that branch
