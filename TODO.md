# Full Type Inference Implementation

## Goal
Complete the lexer → parser → semantic analyzer → codegen pipeline for standardizing lazy fortran to Fortran 95, with full Hindley-Milner type inference using Algorithm W.

## Pipeline Architecture

The 4-phase compiler pipeline with JSON intermediate representations:

1. **Lexer**: Source Code → Tokens (outputs tokens.json with --debug-tokens)
2. **Parser**: Tokens → AST (inputs tokens via --from-tokens, outputs ast.json with --debug-ast)
3. **Semantic Analyzer**: AST → Annotated AST (inputs/outputs AST via --from-ast, adds type info with --debug-semantic)
4. **Code Generator**: AST → Fortran 95 code (inputs any AST via --from-ast)

Key insights:
1. The semantic analyzer augments the AST with type information but maintains the same structure
2. Both parser and semantic analyzer use the same JSON serialization (json_writer/json_reader modules)
3. The code generator accepts any AST via --from-ast, whether typed or untyped:
   - **Standard Fortran**: Parser → AST → Codegen (types already explicit)
   - **Lazy Fortran**: Parser → AST → Semantic Analysis → Annotated AST → Codegen (types inferred)

## Success Criteria
- [⚠️] All lazy fortran features compile to valid Fortran 95 - REQUIRES SAFE FORTRAN PRACTICES
- [⚠️] Double standardization test: Running standardizer on its own output produces identical results - REQUIRES MEMORY SAFETY
- [⚠️] Complete test coverage for all Fortran 95 features via frontend_test_cases - REQUIRES SAFE FORTRAN REFACTORING
- [✅] JSON intermediate representations work correctly at all stages - WORKING
- [✅] No shortcuts - everything goes through the real AST pipeline - ENFORCED

#### 10. Type System Improvements
- **type_system_hm.f90**: Fix remaining TVAR handling issues (lines 429, 441)

## Safe Fortran Practices - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

### Overview
All code must follow **Safe Fortran** practices to prevent memory corruption. This includes strict memory management rules, container patterns, and avoiding unsafe operations.

### Memory Management Rules
1. **No manual `deallocate`** - Let Fortran scope handle deallocation automatically
2. **Use `allocatable`, never `pointer`** - Allocatable provides automatic memory management
3. **No shared memory ownership** - Each data structure owns its memory exclusively
4. **Implement proper deep copy operations** - Avoid shallow copies that cause double-free

### Container Patterns
1. **Wrapper pattern for polymorphic arrays**:
   ```fortran
   type :: ast_node_wrapper
       class(ast_node), allocatable :: node
   end type ast_node_wrapper
   ```

2. **Array extension pattern**:
   ```fortran
   ! CORRECT: Use temporary array for extension
   type(ast_node_wrapper), allocatable :: temp_array(:)
   if (allocated(array)) then
       allocate(temp_array(size(array) + 1))
       temp_array(1:size(array)) = array
       temp_array(size(array) + 1) = new_element
       array = temp_array
   else
       array = [new_element]
   end if
   ```

3. **Deep copy operations**:
   ```fortran
   ! Each type must implement deep_copy method
   function deep_copy(this) result(copy)
       class(my_type), intent(in) :: this
       type(my_type) :: copy
       ! Copy all fields, deep copy allocatable components
   end function deep_copy
   ```

### Forbidden Practices
- ❌ Manual `deallocate` calls
- ❌ `pointer` attributes  
- ❌ Direct array extension: `array = [array, new_element]` with function calls
- ❌ Shared memory references between data structures
- ❌ Shallow copies of complex types

   - [ ] Eliminate shared ownership in semantic context

2. **Phase 2: AST Memory Safety**
   - [ ] Remove all manual `deallocate` calls in AST modules

### 5.4 Double Standardization Test ⚠️ BLOCKED BY MEMORY ISSUE
- [⚠️] Test: For each frontend_test_case, standardize output again
- [⚠️] Test: Verify second standardization produces identical output

**CRITICAL MEMORY ISSUE**: The semantic analyzer has a double-free error in the type system destructor:
- Error: `free(): double free detected in tcache 2` in `__deallocate_type_system_hm_Mono_type_t`
- Location: Frontend cleanup at line 111 in frontend.f90
- Impact: Blocks all type inference testing and double standardization
- Status: Memory management fixes attempted but issue persists

**Fixes Attempted**:
1. Fixed create_semantic_context memory corruption
2. Added deep_copy() in create_poly_type and create_fun_type
3. Proper array initialization in create_scope function
4. Added safety checks in env_lookup function

**Current Workaround**:
- Semantic analyzer disabled in pipeline for stability
- Code generation works without type inference
- Basic pipeline (lexer → parser → codegen) functional

**Next Steps**:
- Consider redesigning type system memory management
- Alternative: Switch to simpler type inference approach
- Phase 6 can proceed with basic compilation (no type inference)

## Phase 6: Frontend Test Cases ⚠️ PROCEEDING WITHOUT TYPE INFERENCE

**Status**: Proceeding with basic compilation pipeline (lexer → parser → codegen) without semantic analysis.
This allows testing of the core pipeline while the type inference memory issue is resolved separately.

**Current Limitation**: Type inference disabled, so:
- Variables need explicit type declarations
- No automatic type inference for lazy fortran features
- Basic Fortran 95 compilation still works

**Progress Summary**:
- 9 test cases created across Phase 6.1, 6.3, and 6.4
- 1 test case fully working (single_assignment)
- 4 test cases with duplicate declarations issue (multiple_assignments, arithmetic_ops, string_assignment, logical_assignment)
- 1 test case with array processing issue (array_literal)
- 3 test cases with memory corruption crashes (if_statement, do_loop, simple_function)

**Critical Finding**: AST memory corruption is systemic and blocks all advanced features.
Only simple single-statement assignments work reliably.

### 6.1 Basic Features ✅ PROGRESS
- [x] single_assignment: integer :: x; x = 42 ✅ WORKING
  - Created example/frontend_test_cases/single_assignment/
  - Test: test_phase6_basic.f90 passes
  - Basic pipeline (lexer → parser → codegen) functional
- [⚠️] multiple_assignments: integer :: x, y; x = 1; y = 2 ⚠️ ISSUE
  - Created example/frontend_test_cases/multiple_assignments/
  - Issue: Duplicate variable declarations in output
- [⚠️] arithmetic_ops: integer :: x, y, z; z = x + y * 2 ⚠️ ISSUE
  - Created example/frontend_test_cases/arithmetic_ops/
  - Issue: Duplicate variable declarations in output

  - Created example/frontend_test_cases/array_literal/
  - Issue: Array literal not processed correctly, assignment incomplete

**Known Issues**:
1. **Duplicate variable declarations**: Both `real(8)` and explicit type declarations appear in output
   - Affects: multiple_assignments, arithmetic_ops, string_assignment, logical_assignment
   - Need to fix code generation logic to avoid duplicate declarations
2. **Array literal processing**: Array assignments incomplete (arr = [1, 2, 3] becomes arr =)
   - Affects: array_literal test case
   - Parser or codegen issue with array constructor syntax
3. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Widespread AST memory corruption**:
   - **Pattern**: Any complex AST structures cause crashes in __ast_core_MOD___copy_* operations
   - **Affected**: Control flow (if_statement, do_loop), procedures (simple_function), arrays
   - **Errors**: Segmentation faults, malloc corruption, unaligned tcache chunks
   - **Root cause**: Memory management issues in AST copy operations during parsing
   - **Impact**: Blocks all advanced features beyond simple assignments
   - **Only working**: Simple single-statement assignments with explicit types
