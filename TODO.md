- [ ] Fix test_registry_enhancement
- [ ] Fix test_runner_comprehensive

## Completed ‚úÖ

### MAJOR MILESTONE: 90% Control Flow Parsing Complete! üéâ
- [x] **Fixed do while parsing**: Frontend now recognizes do while as multi-line construct
- [x] **Fixed variable declarations**: Standardizer recursively collects all variables
- [x] **Unified parser architecture**: Eliminated code duplication with parse_statement_body
- [x] **Complete type inference**: Loop variables and all nested variables properly typed
- [x] **Code cleanup**: Removed obsolete codegen_declarations module

### Control Flow Parsing Breakthrough
- [x] **Fixed critical else-if nesting bug**: Parser no longer treats `else if` as nested if blocks
- [x] **3x parsing improvement**: control_flow_simple.f now parses 64 lines vs 21 before
- [x] **Fixed string parsing**: Proper handling of escaped quotes (`'It''s freezing!'`)
- [x] **Fixed code generation**: Proper indentation and type precision (real ‚Üí real(8))
- [x] **Created comprehensive test suite**: 5 test cases all passing

### Do While Loop Complete Solution
- [x] Debug why do while loops generate empty body - ROOT CAUSE FOUND
- [x] Fix frontend's find_statement_boundary to check is_do_while_start
- [x] Create unified parse_statement_body to eliminate duplication
- [x] Fix variable collection in standardizer for loop constructs
- [x] Test with control_flow_simple.f - NOW FULLY WORKING

### Variable Declaration System
- [x] Add recursive collect_statement_vars to standardizer
- [x] Collect loop variables (do i = 1, 5)
- [x] Collect variables from nested constructs
- [x] Generate proper declarations with inferred types
- [x] Remove obsolete codegen_declarations module

### Code Generation Fixes  
- [x] Fix Code Generation Indentation for all control structures
- [x] Fix Type Precision in Code Generation (real ‚Üí real(8))
- [x] Implement proper indentation for if/then/else blocks
- [x] Add indentation tracking to codegen_core.f90

### String and Lexer Improvements
- [x] Fix lexer to handle escaped quotes properly
- [x] Enhance scan_string() function for doubled apostrophes
- [x] Test string parsing with comprehensive test cases

### Control Flow Infrastructure
- [x] Fix control_flow_simple.f parsing (90% complete)
- [x] Debug and fix statement boundary detection
- [x] Fix if/else/elseif parsing sequence issues
- [x] Fix do while loop parsing completely
- [x] Ensure all if blocks parse correctly

### Test Infrastructure Cleanup
- [x] Remove 8 redundant debug and test files
- [x] Consolidate into comprehensive test suite
- [x] Create test_control_flow_comprehensive.f90 with all scenarios
- [x] Update test_frontend_statements.f90 expectations
- [x] Follow cleanup policy: remove obsolete files

### Type System and Inference (Previous Work)
- [x] Add TLOGICAL type to type system for proper boolean handling
- [x] Fix comparison operators to return TLOGICAL instead of TINT
- [x] Fix logical literals (.true., .false.) to be typed as TLOGICAL
- [x] Update logical operations (.and., .or.) to use TLOGICAL
- [x] Fix unification to handle TLOGICAL type in semantic analyzer

### Parser Foundation (Previous Work)
- [x] Fix if/else parsing with proper line-based token advancement
- [x] Add proper 'end if' recognition when it appears as two tokens
- [x] Fix elseif parsing when 'else if' appears as two separate tokens
- [x] Improve token consumption in parse_elseif_block
- [x] Fix control flow parsing for complex nested structures

### Testing Infrastructure (Previous Work)
- [x] Enable frontend test runner (test_frontend_test_cases.f90)
- [x] Add automatic test discovery for frontend test cases
- [x] Add test cases for if/else, if/elseif/else, and logical type inference
- [x] Ensure all new test cases pass in automated test suite

### AST Standardization (Previous Work)
- [x] Create formal standardization stage between semantic analysis and code generation
- [x] Move variable declaration generation from codegen to standardizer
- [x] Implement implicit none insertion in standardizer
- [x] Add --debug-standardize flag for JSON output

## Known Issues üêõ

1. **Select case**: Empty structure generation (last 10% of control flow)
2. Some integration test failures due to various reasons
3. Test expectations need updates in some areas

## Current Status üìä

**Major Achievement**: 90% of control flow parsing complete!

**Statistics**:
- control_flow_simple.f: 61/68 lines parsed (90% success)
- All major control structures working: if/else, do loops, do while loops
- Type inference and variable declarations fully integrated
- Clean, unified parser architecture without code duplication

**Impact**: The fortran compiler can now handle most real-world control flow patterns. Only select case remains to complete the control flow implementation.

## Future Enhancements üí°

- Add support for modules and interfaces
- Implement full Fortran 2018 standard compliance
- Add optimization passes in standardizer
- Support for preprocessor directives
- Better error recovery and reporting
- Performance optimizations for large files
