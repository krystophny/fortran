# Phase 8: Advanced Type Inference Architecture Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current `type_inference.f90` module has grown to 680+ lines and successfully implements:
- ✅ All basic literal types (integer, real, logical, character)
- ✅ Expression evaluation and type propagation
- ✅ Variable declaration generation
- ✅ Integration with preprocessor
- ✅ 41/41 unit tests + 5/5 integration tests passing

## Architecture Problems

The current single-module approach will not scale for advanced features:

1. **Monolithic Design**: Single 680+ line module becoming unmaintainable
2. **String-based Parsing**: No proper AST representation
3. **No Modularity**: Difficult to extend with new analyzers
4. **Complexity Explosion**: Arrays, derived types, procedures will create spaghetti code

## Proposed Modular Architecture

### Core Modules
- `type_system.f90` - Core type definitions and utilities
- `type_environment.f90` - Nested scope and variable tracking
- `declaration_generator.f90` - Code generation

### Analyzer Modules  
- `literal_analyzer.f90` - Current literal detection functionality
- `expression_analyzer.f90` - AST-based expression analysis
- `array_analyzer.f90` - Array shape and dimension inference (Phase 8.1)
- `procedure_analyzer.f90` - Function/subroutine analysis (Phase 8.3)

### Coordinator
- `type_inference_coordinator.f90` - Clean public API, plugin architecture

## Success Criteria

- Each module <300 lines
- Maintainable and extensible
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing tests must pass
- No performance regression
- Foundation for advanced features

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 8.0**: Architecture refactoring (2-3 weeks)
2. **Phase 8.1**: Arrays (1-2 weeks after refactoring)
3. **Phase 8.2**: Derived types (3-4 weeks)  
4. **Phase 8.3**: Procedures (4-6 weeks)
