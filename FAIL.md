# Test Failures Analysis

## Current Test Suite Status

### Failed Tests Summary

1. **test_example_test_cases** - Failed because expected output has incorrect indentation
   - if_else_simple: Missing indentation in if/else blocks
   - if_elseif_else: Missing indentation in if/elseif/else blocks

2. **test_frontend_test_cases** - 15 out of 29 tests failing
   - function_call_inference: Missing contains indentation and type info
   - function_def: Missing contains indentation and type info
   - function_with_param: Missing contains indentation and parameter types
   - single_real_declaration: Generates `real` instead of `real(8)`
   - Various missing input/output files for other tests

3. **test_artifact_cache** - Directory creation permission error
   - Trying to create directories in /var/tmp/ert/XDG-cache/fortran/builds

4. **test_examples** - control_flow_simple.f fails to compile
   - Parser stops after first if block when running through full pipeline
   - Build error prevents execution

5. **test_notebook_system_end2end** - Related to example failures

6. **test_registry_enhancement** - Likely unrelated to parser changes

## Root Causes

### 1. Indentation Issues
The code generator doesn't properly indent:
- Statements inside if/then/else blocks
- Statements inside contains blocks
- Function/subroutine bodies

### 2. Incomplete Parsing
The control_flow_simple.f file only partially parses:
- Stops after first if/endif block
- Subsequent statements are not processed
- May be related to how the parser handles multiple top-level statements

### 3. Type Information Loss
Function definitions lose type information:
- `real(8)` becomes `real`
- Intent attributes are dropped
- Parameter types incomplete

### 4. Missing Standardizer Features
The standardizer needs to:
- Properly indent generated code
- Preserve type precision (real(8) vs real)
- Handle contains blocks correctly

## Working Features

✓ Logical type inference (TLOGICAL)
✓ Basic if/else/elseif parsing
✓ Frontend test infrastructure
✓ Expression parsing and type inference
✓ Assignment handling
✓ Print statement parsing

## Next Steps

See TODO.md for the step-by-step plan to address these issues.
